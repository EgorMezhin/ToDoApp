**Description:**
-----------------------------------
The App is a list of to-do's sorted by categories. Many tasks can be assigned to each category, but each task corresponds to one category. It is possible to create new categories and tasks, as well as delete them and mark them as completed. At different stages of development, different methods of storing data were used - user defaults, core data, realm. The final version uses realm. The Chameleon framework was also used to work with the colors of the cells.
